Elvis is a clone of vi/ex.  It boasts about 97% of the vi commands and about
92% of the ex commands.  It is generally quite fast.  It can edit files that
are larger than a single process' data space.  Elvis also has a few features
that the real vi lacks.  Several related programs are included, too.

Elvis runs under BSD/SysV UNIX, Minix-ST, and (almost certainly) Minix-PC.
Elvis should be fairly easy to port to any OS that has the termcap functions.

It is being posted in six parts.  Each part is a uuencoded compressed tar
archive.  Each part is about 45k bytes long.

Okay, now let's compile it...

Each "step" below includes a general description of what you should do next,
followed by an explicit list of shell commands.  The shell commands should be
viewed as one example of how the step might be accomplished on somebody else's
system -- *NOT* the exact commands that you will need on YOUR system.

On Minix systems, you should be logged in as "root" as you do this.

STEP 1:
	Make a subdirectory called "elvis" somewhere, and unpack the source
	files into it.

		# mkdir /usr/src/commands/elvis
		# cd /usr/src/commands/elvis
		# mv ~/News/elvis* .
		# for i in *
		> do
		>	uudecode $i
		> done
		# uncompress *.Z
		# for i in *.tar
		> do
		>	tar xf $i
		> done
		# rm *.Z *.tar

STEP 2:
	Makefiles are included for Minix-ST, Minix-PC, BSD Unix, and SysV Unix.
	For Xenix, use a modified version of the SysV Makefile  (Instructions
	can be found inside the file "Makefile.s5").

	Anyway, copy the appropriate "Makefile.XXX" to "Makefile".

		# cp Makefile.pc Makefile

STEP 3:
	Make the executables.  You should see no warnings during compilation
	from the standard UNIX or Minix compilers.  ANSI compilers may give
	you a lot of warnings, but they shouldn't give you any errors.

		# make

	(Note: for UNIX systems, STOP HERE!  Minix users continue...)

STEP 4:
	To install the current version of elvis (and related programs) in
	"/usr/bin", use "make install".

		# make install

STEP 5:
	Remove all unnecessary files from the "elvis" directory.

		# make clobber

STEP 6:
	Create a directory called "/usr/tmp".  It must be readable/writable
	by everybody.  Elvis will use this directory to hold temporary files.

		# mkdir /usr/tmp
		# chmod 777 /usr/tmp
